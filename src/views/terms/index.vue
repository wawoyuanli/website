              M. PROVIDE CASH INCENTIVES. Salient Surveys offers cash
              incentives to members in exchange for completing surveys and
              signup for trial offers. Members won't be eligible for cash
              incentives by only completing the surveys. Signing up for the
              offers, advertised by our partners, is necessary in order to be
              eligible for cash incentives. If you complete a survey and sign up
              for the corresponding offer, it will take up to 8 weeks to receive
              the cash funds from the advertiser. Please do not delete the
              confirmation emails you receive from the advertisers. These
              confirmation emails are required in order for us to investigate if
              your account is not credited in 8 weeks. The funds will be sent to
              the paypal e-mail address registered on file with Salient 
              Surveys. If your e-mail address changes and funds have already
              been sent to your e-mail address on file, Salient Surveys
              cannot redirect the funds to your new address. You can change your
              paypal e-mail address in Salient Surveys at any time.
              PayPal.com is a FREE service that allows you to instantly receive
              cash over the Internet. Cash payments will only be made after the
              member's qualification to participate in a particular survey has
              been verified by Salient Surveys, the member completes that
              survey and offer. Salient Surveys is not responsible if you
              lose, or misplace your funds via email. All cash payment amounts
              may be changed or modified at any time and at the discretion of
              Salient Surveys. Members are responsible for any taxes due as a
              result of payments made for their participation in Salient Surveys.

              N.3, FRAUD USERS, Recently we have found that many of our users
              are creating fake accounts and using fraudulent credit cards to
              sign up for surveys. This is causing our sponsors to shut down
              their merchant accounts, and stop business with us sometime
              resulting in no payment. As a result, we will be paying all of our
              members 30 days after approval of the transaction so we have
              enough time to sift through the fraudulent users who cause this,
              with helpful information from our advertisers.
            </div>
            <div class="ml-2 mt-2">
              N.4, We will be taking legal action if we find any of our members
              having dummy accounts (more than one [1]) per house hold (as
              stated in our terms and conditions) or people using prepaid or
              fraudulent credit cards with our sponsors (advertisers). If you
              are found to have done any of the above stated points, your
              account will be terminated with all earnings being held, plus any
              necessary legal action.
